I would expose the factory pattern approach to application developers because it provides a simple, consistent interface for creating complex objects without exposing construction details. This approach encapsulates the complexity of drink customization behind intuitive product codes, making the API easy to use and understand. Developers can create sophisticated drink combinations like "ESP+SHOT+OAT" with a single method call, without needing to know about the underlying object relationships. This maintains clean separation of concerns while keeping the learning curve minimal for new developers working with the codebase.
